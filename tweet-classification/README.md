This project was aimed at finding the location from where the tweet was tweeted. I trained a Naive Bayes Classifier on the training set to find the location of tweets in the test set. Implemented multinomial documents model using bag-of-words. Employed the principle of maximimizing likelihood in order to compare the posteriers.
