In the project, I worked upon to find the best optimal path between a given pair of citiies and compared different graph seach algorithms, namley, Breadth First Search, Dpeth FIrst Search, Uniform Cost, and A-star. 

The dataset consisits of North American (though mostly U.S.) major roads.

city-gps.txt contains one line per city, with three fields per line, delimited by spaces. The first field is the city, followed by the latitude, followed by the longitude.

road-segments.txt has one line per road segment connecting two cities.
The space delimited fields are:

- first city
- second city
- length (in miles)
- speed limit (in miles per hour)
- name of highway
